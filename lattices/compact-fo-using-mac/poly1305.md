# Poly1305
One of the two message authentication scheme accepted by TLS 1.3 (the other being GCM).

The secret key consists of two parts $(k, r)$ where $k$ is a 128-bit block cipher key (e.g. AES key, or ChaCha20 key) and $r$ is also 128 bit but treated differently:

1. `r = r[0] || r[1] || ... || r[15]` is treated as the little-endian representation of an unsigned integer
2.  `r[3], r[7], r[11], r[15]` must be within the range `0x00..=0x0F` (high order 4 bits are 0's)
3. `r[4], r[8], r[12]` must be multiples of 4 (low-order 2 bits are 0's)

We also need a 16-byte nonce that does not repeat for distinct messages, this can be done using a counter.

## Message conversion and padding
Message is treated as a byte string. it is first converted to blocks of 16 bytes, where each block
