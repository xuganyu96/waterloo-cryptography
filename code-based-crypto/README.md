# Code-based cryptography
- [ ] is classic McEliece OW-PCA secure?  
    - If yes, state the additional assumption needed, maybe we need a "gap syndrome-decoding assumption"
    - If no, describe a plaintext-checking attack
- [ ] the linear algebra in classic McEliece is a good candidate for GPU acceleration
- [ ] the many rounds of proofs in CROSS are good candidate for GPU acceleration
- [ ] cryptanalysis on R-SDP/R-SDP(G), the underlying hard problem for CROSS
