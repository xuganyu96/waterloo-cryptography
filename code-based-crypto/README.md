# Code-based cryptography
- [ ] What is the Berlekamp-Massey decoder?
- [ ] is classic McEliece OW-PCA secure?  
    - If yes, state the additional assumption needed, maybe we need a "gap syndrome-decoding assumption"
    - If no, describe a plaintext-checking attack
- [ ] the linear algebra in classic McEliece is a good candidate for GPU acceleration
- [ ] there is a 2002 Reed-Solomon decoder based on extended Euclid algorithm [here](./references/A%20new%20algorithm%20for%20decoding%20reed-solomon%20codes.pdf)
- [ ] the many rounds of proofs in CROSS are good candidate for GPU acceleration
- [ ] cryptanalysis on R-SDP/R-SDP(G), the underlying hard problem for CROSS

[Xagawa 21](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-92075-3_2) claims:

> there is no known KR-PCA against classic McEliece
