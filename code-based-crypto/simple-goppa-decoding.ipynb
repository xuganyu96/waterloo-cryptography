The best approximant theorem tries to find polynomials $a, b \\in K[x]$ of much lower degree $t$ such that $aB - bA$ has low degree. $a, b$ are called approximant because if $aB - bA$ has low degree, then $\\frac{a}{b}$ is a good approximation of $\\frac{A}{B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best approximant theorem.** Let $K$ be a field and $K[x]$ denote the ring of polynomials. For every $A, B \\in K[x]$ such that $\\deg(A) > \\deg(B)$ and non-zero integer $t \\geq 0$ such that $2t < \\deg(A)$, there exists polynomials $a, b \\in K[x]$ such that:\n",

Thus, the set of coefficients of $a, b$ together form a $2t+1$ dimensional vector space. On the other hand, $\\deg(aB + bA) = \\max(\\deg(aB), \\deg(bA))$. Since $\\deg(aB) = \\deg(a) + \\deg(B) < n + t$ and $\\deg(bA) = \\deg(b) + \\deg(A) < n + t$, we know that $\\deg(aB + bA) < n + t$. Thus we can write $aB + bA$ as:\n",

Since it is easy to write out $aB - bA$ explicitly in terms of $(a, b)$, we can find such non-zero $(a, b)$ using Gaussian elimination on a $K^{2t \\times (2t+1)}$ matrix.\n",
