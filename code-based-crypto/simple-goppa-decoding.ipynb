    "In [\"Understanding binary-Goppa decoding\"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/473), a binary-Goppa decoder is constructed using an original-view Reed-Solomon decoder: let $\\mathbb{F}$ be some finite field, $\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n$ be distinct elements, and let $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{e} \\in \\mathbb{F}^n$ be the received codeword with $\\mathop{wt}(\\mathbf{e}) \\leq t$.

Since $\\deg(aB) = \\deg(a) + \\deg(B) < n + t$ and $\\deg(bA) = \\deg(b) + \\deg(A) < n + t$, we know that $\\deg(aB + bA) < n + t$. Thus we can write $aB + bA$ as:\n",
