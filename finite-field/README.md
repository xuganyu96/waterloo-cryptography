There are a few important results about finite fields that I want to review and understand

- [ ] All finite fields take the form $\mathbb{F}_q$ where $q = p^k$ for some prime $p \geq 2$ and positive power $k > 1$
- [ ] Two finite fields of the same order are isomorphic to each other
    - [ ] How does one find/construct the isomorphism from one field to another?
- [ ] Finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ where $q = p^k$ can be viewed as a vector space whose vectors are $x \in \mathbb{F}_q$ and whose scalars are $a \in \mathbb{F}_p$
- [ ] The multiplicative subgroup $\mathbb{F}_q^\ast$ is cyclic
