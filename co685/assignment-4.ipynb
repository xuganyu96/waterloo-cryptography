    "Denote an existential forgery adversary by $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ and the discrete log adversary by $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{DLog}$. Note that the security parameters, the ambient group (cyclic group $G = \\langle g \\rangle$ with prime order $p$), and the key generations (sample random $x \\leftarrow \\mathbb{Z}_p$ and compute $g^x$) are identical between the discrete log problem and the Schnorr signature), so when $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{DLog}$ receives the discrete-log problem $(1^\\lambda, (p, G, g), g^x)$, it can feed the parameters to a forgery adversary and asks the forger to produce a forgery.\n",

    "Under the random oracle assumption, $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{DLog}$ plays the role of the hash function oracle for when $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ queries the hash of some chosen inputs. Since the $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ is trying to forge valid signature $\\sigma = (\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2)$, we can safely assume that $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ needs to query the random oracle for the first half of the forgery $\\sigma_1$. Denote the adversary's input by $(m, g^r)$ (note that the input of $H$ requires the second element to have the form $g^r$, although in this context $r$ may or may not be random) and the random oracle's output by $\\sigma_1$, then by the validity of the signature we know that\n",

Note that because $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{DLog}$ feeds $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ with the same random tape, $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ will execute identically up to the forking point, which means that the value of $m, g^r$ will be the same as in the first execution. By the forking lemma, $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{DLog}$ can return a distinct (but still randomly looking) results for this hash query, and $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ will retain its advantage. Denote the hash output by $\\sigma_1^\\prime$. By the results above we know with high confidence that $\\sigma_2^\\prime = r + x \\sigma_1^\\prime$.\n",
