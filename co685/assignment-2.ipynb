    "We begin by claiming the following two facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $x$ is a square root to $a$ in a composite $n = p \\cdot q$ modulo system, then $x$ is a square root to $a$ in both modulo $p$ and modulo $q$\n",
    "2. If $x$ is a square root to $a$ in both modulo $p$ and modulo $q$, then $x$ is a square root to $a$ in modulo $n = p \\cdot q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first fact is trivial: if $x^2 \\equiv a \\mod (p \\cdot q)$, then $x^2 = k \\cdot p \\cdot q + a$ for some integer $k$ (note that this is NOT Euclidean dvision). Taking modulo $p$ or $q$ of this equation yields the prime congruences.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if $x^2 \\equiv a$ for both $\\mod p$ and $\\mod q$, then there exists integer $k, l$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^2 = kp + a = lq + a\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging the equation above we have $kp = lq$. Since $p, q$ are both prime, we know that $k$ must be divisible by $q$: $k = k^\\prime q,\\; k^\\prime \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, hence we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^2 = k^\\prime\\cdot q \\cdot p + a\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $x^2 \\equiv a \\mod (p \\cdot q)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know that square roots in the composite congruence is equivalent to square roots in the component congruences, we can start with a solution in the composite congruence and find the other three roots using the component congruence. Here is how:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $x_0$ is a root to the composite congruence $x_0^2 \\equiv a \\mod n$, then we know that $x_0$ is also a root to each of the composite congruence. Then from assignment 1 we know that $p - x_0$ is a square root in modulo $p$ and $q - x_0$ is a square root in modulo $q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "x_0^2 &\\equiv a \\mod p\\\\\n",
    "(p-x_0)^2 &\\equiv a \\mod p \\\\\n",

    "(q - x_0)^2 &\\equiv a \\mod q\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one \"$\\mod p$\" congruence and one \"$\\mod q$\" congruence and solve the system using the Chinese remainder theorem, the solution is a square root to the composite congruence. There are four distinct combinations of such choices, hence there are four distinct square roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## b)\n",
    "Suppose we have a composite square root oracle, we can ask the oracle to solve the following square root:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know this equation to have a trivial solution $x = 1$, so by the result from part (a) we know there are four distinct square roots. We also know from part (a) that the four roots are also square roots of 1 for modulo each of the prime factors. Trivially, the square roots of 1 modulo any prime factors are $1$ and $-1$, so the four square roots are CRT solutions to the following four possible pairs of congruences:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "x &\\equiv \\pm 1 \\mod p \\\\\n",
    "x &\\equiv \\pm 1 \\mod q \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the four roots given by the oracle, there are two trivial roots: $1$ and $n-1$. They correspond to the systems in which the right hand sides are both $1$ or are both $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote the two remaining non-trivial square roots by $c_1, c_2$. Without loss of generality (if the relations don't hold then we can just swap $c_1$ and $c_2$) we observe that:\n",
    "\n",

    "c_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod q\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that $c_1 - 1$ and $c_2 + 1$ are both multiples of the unknown prime factor $p$. We also know that $n = pq$ where $q$ is prime, so the greatest common divisor between $c_1 - 1$ and $n$ is exactly p. Once we know one of the factor, we can easily compute the other factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in short, the algorithm goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. let (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4) = square_root_oracle(remainder = 1, modulo = n)\n",
    "2. exclude among the roots 1 and n - 1\n",
    "3. Take one of the remaining root \"c\" and compute gcd(n, c + 1); this is one of the prime factor\n",
    "4. Use the known prime factor to compute the other prime factor\n",
