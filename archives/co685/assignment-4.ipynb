    "The parameters and the keys are sampled from identical distribution across the two games: $G$ is a cyclic group with prime order $p$, $g$ is a generator of $G$, $x$ is uniformly randomly sampled from $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, and the public key is $g^x$. This means that when $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{DLog}$ receives its inputs, it can pass these inputs to $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$, and $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ will retain its advantage when forging signatures.\n",

    "If we assume that $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ has non-negligible advantage, then we can safely assume that at some point during the execution of the forgery procedure, $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{EUF}$ will need to query the hash of the message that it is trying to forge a signature for. By the definition of the hash function $H: \\mathcal{M} \\times G \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_p$, the input of the query takes the form $(m, g^r)$ where $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$. By the random oracle assumption, $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{DLog}$ can play the role of the random oracle and output some random element from $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. By the definition of the signature we know that this output is the first part of the forged signature, so we denote it by $\\sigma_1$.\n",

Denote the forgery by $\\sigma^\\prime = (\\sigma_1^\\prime, \\sigma_2^\\prime)$. By the same argument as above, we can be very confident that $\\sigma_2^\\prime = r + \\sigma_1^\\prime x$\n",
