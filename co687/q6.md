# Problem 6

## a)
**Using non-distinct primes to generate the modulus is a bad idea** because there exists logarithmic "integer square roots" algorithm. This means that knowing the modulus to be an integer square, an adversary can efficiently factor the modulus and thus break the encryption.

Note: here is a $O(\log(N))$ implementation of integer square root:

```python
def fast_intsqrt(n: int) -> int | None:
    """return the integer square root if it exists; else return 0
    """
    if n < 0:
        return None
    # Binary search the smallest x such that x^2 >= n
    x = jump = n // 2 + 1
    print(x, jump)
    while jump > 0:
        while x - jump >= 0 and (x - jump) * (x - jump) >= n:
            x -= jump
            print(x, jump)
        jump = jump // 2
        print(x, jump)
    
    if x * x == n:
        return x
    return None
```

## b)
Denote the two distinct public exponents by $e_1, e_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the common message to be $m \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$. Assuming that $e_1, e_2$ are relatively prime, we can use the extended Euclid algorithm to find integers $r_1, r_2$ such that:

$$
r_1e_1 + r_2e_2 = 1
$$

Recall that the ciphertexts of the common message $m$ under the two exponents are $c_1 \equiv m_1^{e_1} \mod n$ and $c_2 \equiv m_2^{e_2} \mod n$. The adversary can raise the two ciphertexts to $r_1$ and $r_2$ exponents respectively, then multiply them together:

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_1^{r_1} \cdot c_2^{r_2} &\equiv (m^{e_1})^{r_1} \cdot (m^{e_2})^{r_2} \mod n \\
&\equiv m^{r_1e_1 + r_2e_2} \mod n \\
&\equiv m \mod n
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus the adversary has obtained the message

## c)
If the adversary knows that Alice and Alicia are using related modulus $N_1 = pq$ and $N_2 = pr$, then the adversary can use the Euclid algorithm to find the GCD between $N_1, N_2$, which will be the common prime factor $p$ with extremely high probability. The adversary can then use $p$ to find the other two factors $q, r$, thus breaking RSA.
