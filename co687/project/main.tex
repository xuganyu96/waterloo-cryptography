\section*{Acknowledgement}
Thank you to Vinod Vaikuntanathan\cite{mit-cs294} and Daniele Micciancio\cite{ucsd-cse206a}, for publishing the lecture notes from MIT's CS294 and UCSD's CSE206A respectively, as well as Chris Peikert\cite{peikert2016decade} for his survey \textit{A decade of lattice cryptography}. The content from these lecture notes and survey inspired this project and provided a wealth of technical details that this project is based on.

\section{Introduction}
Trapdoor functions are the foundations of public-key cryptography. The most famous and popular trapdoor functions include the RSA trapdoor (it is easy to compute $m^e$ from $m$ and $e$ but difficult to recover $m$ from $m^e$ and $e$) and discrete log (it is easy to compute $g^x$ from $g, x$ but hard to recover $x$ from $g^x, g$). While these two trapdoors have been proved very successful over their decades of application, they are unfortunately both based on the hardness of integer factorization. Trapdoor functions based on other classes of hard problems have been of research interest since the early days of public-key cryptography, and they have gained increased attention efficient quantum factorization algorithm threatens the security guarantee of RSA and Diffie-Hellman schemes.

This project surveys a particular class of cryptographic trapdoor functions whose construction is based on lattices and whose security is based on the hardness of lattice problems such as the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP). In section 2, we will state these hard problems and discuss solutions including the nearest plane algorithm and the LLL basis reduction algorithm. In section 3, we will introduce the Goldreich-Golwasser-Halevi trapdoor construction and its applications.

\subsection{Notations and preliminaries}
Troughout this survey, vectors are denoted with bolded letters $\mathbf{v}$ while matrices are denoted by capital letters $B$. A basis $B \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times b}$ is assumed to be full-rank integer matrix unless explicitly stated. The lattice generated by $B$ is denoted by $\mathcal{L}(B) = \{B\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n \}$. The linear span of $B$ is denoted by $\operatorname{span}(B) = \{B\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \}$.

Given a basis $B$, the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm returns a second basis $B^\ast$ that spans the same linear space as $B$, but whose base vectors are pairwise orthogonal:

$$
\mathbf{b}_i^\ast = \mathbf{b}_i - \sum_{j<i}\mu_{i, j}\mathbf{b}_j^\ast,
\text{where} \; \mu_{i, j} = \frac{
    \langle \mathbf{b}_i, \mathbf{b}_j^\ast\rangle
}{\langle \mathbf{b}_j^\ast, \mathbf{b}_j^\ast\rangle}
$$

We define a projection of $\mathbf{x} \in \operatorname{span}(B)$ onto the set of orthogonalized basis $\{\mathbf{b}_j\}_{j=i}^n$ by the function $\pi_i$:

$$
\pi_i(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{j \geq i} \frac{
    \langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{b}_j^\ast\rangle
}{
    \langle \mathbf{b}_j^\ast, \mathbf{b}_j^\ast \rangle
} \mathbf{b}_j^\ast
$$

It is easy to see that for $i = 1$, $\pi_i(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}$ is the identity function. Also, we can show that $\pi_i(\mathbf{b}_i) = \mathbf{b}_i^\ast$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi_i(\mathbf{b}_i) 
&= \sum_{j\geq i}\frac{\langle \mathbf{b}_i, \mathbf{b}_j^\ast\rangle}{\langle \mathbf{b}_j^\ast, \mathbf{b}_j^\ast \rangle}\mathbf{b}_j^\ast \\
&= \sum_{j\geq i}\mu_{i, j}\mathbf{b}_j^\ast \\
&= \sum_{1 \leq j \leq n}\mu_{i, j}\mathbf{b}_j^\ast  - \sum_{j < i}\mu_{i, j}\mathbf{b}_j^\ast \\
&= \pi_1(\mathbf{b}_i) - \sum_{j < i}\mu_{i, j}\mathbf{b}_j^\ast \\
&= \mathbf{b}_i - \sum_{j < i}\mu_{i, j}\mathbf{b}_j^\ast \\
&= \mathbf{b}_i^\ast
\end{aligned}

\section{Conclusion and final comments}
In this project, we reviewed some fundamental results of lattices, analyzed the difficulty of hard lattice problems and the efficiency of their best known solutions. We then discussed a lattice trapdoor construction that takes advantage of an exponential gap between short basis and long basis in their ability to solve the closest vector problem, and applied the trapdoor to build a public key cryptosystem and a digital signature scheme.

Both the public-key cryptosystem and the signature scheme have been cryptanalyzed \cite{nguyen1999cryptanalysis}\cite{nguyen2006learning} in their original proposed form. However, the idea of using a pair of short and long basis to build trapdoors has been extended in later studies. Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan developed this idea into the GPV framework\cite{gentry2008trapdoors} that later led to FALCON, a digital signature scheme that was submitted to NIST's post-quantum cryptography competition. This idea was also behind NTRUSign\cite{hoffstein2003ntrusign}, whose post-quantum variant was also submitted to NIST's post-quantum cryptography competition.
