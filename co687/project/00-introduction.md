# Lattice-based cryptographic trapdoors
Trapdoor functions are the foundations of public-key cryptography. The most famous and popular trapdoor functions include the RSA trapdoor (it is easy to compute $m^e$ from $m$ and $e$ but difficult to recover $m$ from $m^e$ and $e$) and discrete log (it is easy to compute $g^x$ from $g, x$ but hard to recover $x$ from $g^x, g$). While these two trapdoors have been proved very successful over their decades of application, they are unfortunately both based on the hardness of integer factorization. Trapdoor functions based on other classes of hard problems have been of research interest since the early days of public-key cryptography, and they have gained particular attention as a result of the discovery of efficient quantum algorithm for integer factorization that threatens to break encryption and signature schemes based on RSA and Diffie-Hellman.

In this project is a survey a particular class of cryptographic trapdoor functions whose construction is based on lattices and whose security is based on the hardness of lattice problems such as the shortest vector problem (SVP). Some preliminary mathematics related to lattice will be introduced in section 2, followed by a discussion of GGH's constructions in 1997 in section 3, including . We will conclude by discussing a newer construction from Gentry et al. in section 4, which forms the basis of FALCON, one of the submissions to NIST's post-quantum cryptography competition.
