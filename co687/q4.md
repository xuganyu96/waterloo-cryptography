# Problem 4
The augmented AE scheme is not IND-CPA because **the chosen MAC is deterministic and used on the plaintext. Therefore, if the two halves of the plaintext are identical, then the two halves of the tag are guaranteed to be identical**.

An adversary can construct $m_1 = m_1[0] \Vert m_1[1]$ and $m_2 = m_2[0] \Vert m_2[1]$ such that the two halves of the first message are identical $m_1[0] = m_1[1]$ while the two halves of the second message are not identical $m_2[0] \neq m_2[1]$. When the adversary receives the challenge ciphertexts $c = (c_1, c_2, t_1, t_2)$, it claims the ciphertext to be the authenticated encryption of $m_1$ if $t_1 = t_2$, otherwise it claims authenticated encryption of $m_2$. The probability that the adversary loses is the probability that the tags of two distinct messages are identical, which is $2^{-l}$. Therefore, this adversary will have overwhelming advantage at winning the IND-CPA game.
