    "The approach in part (b) relies on the assumption that the same character at the same offset in each plaintext block is always encrypted to the same character in the ciphertext (e.g. if an $A$ at offset $2$ of one plaintext block is encrypted to $E$, then any $A$ at offset $2$ of all plaintext blocks is encrypted to $E$). However, this assumption is not true for the transposition cipher, where the corresponding ciphertext character of a block depends on the content of the rest of the block. Therefore, **computing index of coincidence using aligned ciphertext blocks is not an effective approach to identify the blocksize of a transposition cipher**."
