# Problem 2

## a)
Alice's password is `"excitement"`

## b)
```python
import hashlib

SALT = "27615912"
HASH = bytes.fromhex("aacc7cb90ee724457d09b06024761ac51f791d3394438442f950b17a31e16baf")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for x in range(0, 999999+1):
        password = f"{x:06d}"
        hash = hashlib.sha256((SALT + password).encode())
        if HASH == hash.digest():
            print(password)
```

The password is `918465`

## c)
Here is Alice's password strategy:

1. Password is always 12 characters long
2. The first part is an English word with the first letter capitalized
3. The last part is a single special character (one of `!, ?, *, $, #`)
4. Between the word and the special character, insert as many random integers as needed to reach the desired length

Here is the code

```python
import hashlib

SPECIAL_CHARS = "!?*$#"
PWD_LEN = 12
SALT = "89535971"
HASH = "9edabf325bc63599725e1aa6a01a9b1a0bc09ff264bdbe7debb35f73a352a2cc"

def password_gen(
    special_chars: str,
    password_len: int,
    words: list[str],
):
    for word in words:
        word = word.capitalize()
        ndigits = password_len - 1 - len(word)
        for num in range(10 ** ndigits):
            for special_char in special_chars:
                num = str(num).zfill(ndigits)
                password = word + num + special_char
                yield password

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("inputs/a3q2word_list.txt") as f:
        words = f.read().splitlines()

    nhashes = 0
    for password in password_gen(SPECIAL_CHARS, PWD_LEN, words):
        password = SALT + password
        hash = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
        nhashes += 1
        if hash == HASH:
            print(password)
    
    print(nhashes)
```

The recovered password is `"Steering799!"` and we used 68,064,796 hashes before finding the password. With the given dictionary, there are a total of 79,683,500 distinct possible passwords.

## d)
The total number of distinct password is as follows:

$$
\text{num of distinct passwords} = 20000 \cdot 20000 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 6 = 2,400,000,000,000
$$

So we require this many hashes to obtain the hash of all passwords. My program checked 68,064,796 hashes in part (c), so the new password stragey does provide additional cryptographic strength

## e)
With a 110 TH/s machine, it takes 0.02182 seconds to try all hashes.

## f)
They could require the password to be longer or allow a bigger range of special characters, both of which will quickly increase the number of distinct possible passwords.
