    "I found the following cryptographic weaknesses in the encryption procedure from the attacker log\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`seed = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")` is weak source of entropy**. The value of the seed only changes every minute, and the change is predictable. The encryption scheme should use a stronger and more unpredictable source of entropy such as system noise (e.g. `os.urandom` in Python) or radioactive decay\n",
    "1. **The RSA modulus is generated incorrectly: the two prime factors are too close**. When the two prime factors are very close, the RSA modulus $n$ is very close to a perfect square, which means that trial divisions that start at the square root of $n$ can efficiently find a factorization. Instead, the two prime factors should be generated independently (but with similar lengths).\n",
    "1. **IV is hard coded**, which makes the CBC mode of operation deterministic. Instead, a different (a possibly random) IV should be generated for each run of the encryption.\n",
    "1. **The public exponent is not necessarily invertible under $\\phi(n)$**. In the attacker log, the public exponent is simply randomly generated without checking whether it is invertible under modulus $\\phi(n)$. While for a ransomwhere attack, correct decryption might not be important, in normal usage of RSA the public exponent must be invertible under $\\phi$ for the secret key to be defined.\n",
    "1. **The public modulus $n = pq$ is too short**. In `gen_rsa_pk`, both both primes are 256 bits in length, so the overall public modulus is 512 bits, which is too short. Instead, a minimum of 1024 bits key size is needed, and 2048 bits key size is recommended.\n",
    "1. **There is no integrity of ciphertext**. Instead, a MAC should be used to ensure the integrity of the ciphertext.\n",

By the fundamental theorem of algebra we know there can be up to two distinct solutions, and knowing that the only $y$ term is a quadratic term, we know that if there are two solutions, then they are mirrors of each other across x-axis. Denote the two solutions by $X_1, X_2$, then we know one of them is exactly $r_1Q$ and $X_1 = -X_2$.\n",
