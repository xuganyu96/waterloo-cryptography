    "1. **`seed = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")` is weak source of entropy**. The value of the seed only changes every minute, and the change is predictable. The encryption scheme should use a stronger and more unpredictable source of entropy such as system noise (e.g. `os.urandom` in Python) or radioactive decay\n",
    "1. **The RSA modulus is generated incorrectly: the two prime factors are too close**. When the two prime factors are very close, the RSA modulus $n$ is very close to a perfect square, which means that trial divisions that start at the square root of $n$ can efficiently find a factorization. Instead, the two prime factors should be generated independently (but with similar lengths).\n",
    "1. **IV is hard coded**, which makes the CBC mode of operation deterministic. Instead, a different (a possibly random) IV should be generated for each run of the encryption.\n",
    "1. **The encryption is not authenticated**, which allows tampering of the ciphertext without detection. Do note that in a ransomware attack maybe ciphertext authenticity is not very important, but in general it is a good idea to authenticate the ciphertext using a MAC.\n",

By the fundamental theorem of algebra we know there can be up to two distinct solutions, and knowing that the only $y$ term is a qudratic term, we know that if there are two solutions, then they are mirrors of each other across x-axis. Denote the two solutions by $X_1, X_2$, then we know one of them is exactly $r_1Q$ and $X_1 = -X_2$.\n",
