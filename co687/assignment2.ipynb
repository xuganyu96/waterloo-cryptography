    "\n",
    "Recall that in OFB mode, a key stream is computed by repeatedly encrypting the IV under the same encryption key. Let $c^*$ be the challenge ciphertext, $m^*$ be the corresponding message, $n$ be the length of the plaintext in \"number of blocks\", and $\\text{IV}$ denote the fixed IV, then by the definition of OFB, we have the following:\n",

    "From here, the adversary can recover the key stream: $\\text{key stream} = c_0 \\oplus m_0$, and since the encryption oracle both the same encryption key and the same IV, the key stream is exactly what's used to encrypt the challenge plaintext, so the adversary can apply this key stream to the challenge ciphertext and recover the plaintext\n",

    "## b)\n",
    "**When each IV is guaranteed to be unique, the OFB mode is OW-CPA secure**. We will prove the OW-CPA security by showing that if there exists probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) adversary who can win the OW-CPA game, then there exists a second PPT adversary who can distinguish the underlying block cipher from truly random permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the OW-CPA adversary outputs the \"challenge IV\" and receives the challenge ciphertext. For the OW-CPA adversary to win the game, it can recover the message, and thus the key stream. Note that the first block of key stream is the encryption of the challenge IV: $E(k, IV^*)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the block cipher adversary sends the challenge IV to the block cipher challenger and receives $h$, which has a 50% chance of being the output of the block cipher under the same key and 50% chance of being a truly random permutation. However, since the block cipher adversary has access to $E(k, IV^*)$ and the block cipher itself is necessarily deterministic, the block cipher adversary can check whether $h = E(k, IV^*)$. Since half of the time $h$ equals $E(k, IV^*)$, the advantage of the block cipher adversary is half the advantage of the OW-CPA adversary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if the OW-CPA adversary has non-negligible advantage, then the block cipher adversary will also have non-negligible advantage."
