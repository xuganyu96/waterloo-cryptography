# Problem 1

## a)
For this question, I plan to implement authenticated encryption using the "encrypt-then-MAC" approach. This means the encryption will largely follow this procedure:

1. Derive key from password
2. Pad the plaintext
3. Obtain ciphertext, where the block cipher is set to CTR mode and uses the padded plaintext and the derived key
4. Compute the tag from the ciphertext
5. Return the ciphertext and the tag

The decryption will be a reversal of the encryption algorithm:

1. Derive key from password
2. Separate "authenticated ciphertext" into the tag and the ciphertext
3. Verify that the tag is a valid signature of the ciphertext; if the verification fail, abort the decryption
4. Decrypt the ciphertext to obtain padded plaintext
5. Unpad the padded plaintext to recover the true message


Note that in the context of this question we know the tag to be obtained from an HMAC with SHA3-256, so we can simply hardcode the first (or last) 256 bits of the input "authenticated ciphertext" to be the tag. In production environment (such as with TLS), the choice of MAC needs to be encoded elsewhere so that the number of bits used for the tag can depend on the choice of the MAC algorithm.

def encrypt(message):
    
    # encode the string as a byte string, since cryptographic functions usually work on bytes

    # Use getpass to prompt the user for a password
    password = getpass.getpass("Enter password:")
    password2 = getpass.getpass("Enter password again:")

    # Do a quick check to make sure that the password is the same!
    if password != password2:
        sys.stderr.write("Passwords did not match")
        sys.exit()

    ### END: This is what you have to change

    # decode the byte string back to a string
    return plaintext.decode('utf-8')
```

## c)
There are a few sources of overhead:

1. Padding will add up to an additional block's worth of overhead to the plaintext, which is up to 128 bits
2. Block cipher in CTR mode adds an additional block from the nonce, which is 128 bits
3. The messsage authentication code uses SHA3-256, which adds an additional 256 bits

Overall, this authenticated encryption scheme adds up to 512 bits of overhead from padding, nonce, and the tag.
