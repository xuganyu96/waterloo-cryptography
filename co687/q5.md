# Problem 5

## a)
$A(k, x) = F(k, x) \Vert F(k, x)$ is not indistinguishable from truly random functions because for $A$ the **first half and the second half of the output is always identical** while in a truly random function, having identical halves is overwhelmingly unlikely.

We can construct an adversary who outputs "not random" if the first half of $A(k, x)$ is identical to the second half of $A(k, x)$. By the argument above, this adversary has overwhelming advantage.

## b)
$B(k, x_1 \Vert x_2) = F(k, x_1) \oplus F(k, x_2)$ is not indistinguishable from truly random function under CPA because **if the two halves of the input are identical, then the output of the function is guaranteed to be all 0's**.

We can construct an adversary who queries the output of some $x_0 = x_0[0] \Vert x_0[1]$ such that $x_0[0] = x_0[1]$. If the returned result is all 0's then the adversary claims the challenge output to be non-random. The probability that this adversary is wrong is the probability that a truly-random string has all 0's, which is overwhelmingly unlikely, so this adversary will have overwhelming advantage.

## c)
$C(k, x) = F(k, 0 \Vert x) \Vert F(k, 1 \Vert x)$ is a secure PRF. We will prove the security of this PRF by showing that if there exists PPT adversary $\mathcal{A}_C$ who distinguish $C$ from truly random, then we can build a second PPT adversary $\mathcal{A}_F$ who can distinguish $F$ from random.

First, $\mathcal{A}_F$ samples a random $x \leftarrow \{0, 1\}^*$, then queries the output of $0 \Vert x \mapsto F(k, 0 \Vert x)$ and $1 \Vert x \mapsto F(k, 1 \Vert x)$. $\mathcal{A}_F$ concatenates the two outputs and gives it to $\mathcal{A}_C$. If $\mathcal{A}_C$ claims the given input to be not random, then $\mathcal{A}_F$ claims $F$ to be not random.
