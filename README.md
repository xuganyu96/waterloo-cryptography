# What's next

## Code-based cryptography

## Implementing post-quantum signature and key exchange in Bluetooth LE
- [This](https://github.com/bluekitchen/btstack) is Pi Pico W's Bluetooth stack
- [Micro:bit v2](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/s113) also has bluetooth. I need to find its source code

## Make Raspberry Pi Pico into a YubiKey?

## Re-visit cryptography fundamentals
- What is PRF, PRP? 
- How to model hash function and/or MAC as PRF?
- Merkle-Damgaard construction, why it is insecure if used directly has a MAC, why is HMAC secure?
