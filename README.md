# What's next
There is a [compiler-introduced timing variability in Kyber](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/hqbtIGFKIpU). Maybe I can try to replicate the result, with Rust. The [Clangover](https://github.com/antoonpurnal/clangover) repository referenced the following two side-channel vulnerability papers:

- [Generic Side-channel attacks on CCA-secure lattice-based PKE and KEM schemes](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/948)
- [Curse of Re-encryption: A Generic Power/EM Analysis on Post-Quantum KEMs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/849)
